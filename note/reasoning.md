# Reasoning Frameworks

Reasoning frameworks like ReAct, Chain-of-Thought, or Tree-of-Thoughts

# ReAct (Reason + Act)

- ReAct is inspired by the synergies between "acting" and "reasoning" which
  allow humans to learn new tasks and make decisions or reasoning.

- ReAct is a general paradigm that combines reasoning and acting with LLMs.
  ReAct prompts LLMs to generate verbal reasoning traces and actions for a task.
  This allows the system to perform dynamic reasoning to create, maintain, and
  adjust plans for acting while also enabling interaction to external
  environments (e.g., Wikipedia) to incorporate additional information into the
  reasoning. The figure below shows an example of ReAct and the different steps
  involved to perform question answering.

- React prompting:

```
Question What is the elevation range for the area that the eastern sector of the
Colorado orogeny extends into?
Thought 1 I need to search Colorado orogeny, find the area that the eastern sector
of the Colorado orogeny extends into, then find the elevation range of the
area.
Action 1 Search[Colorado orogeny]
Observation 1 The Colorado orogeny was an episode of mountain building (an orogeny) in
Colorado and surrounding areas.
Thought 2 It does not mention the eastern sector. So I need to look up eastern
sector.
Action 2 Lookup[eastern sector]
Observation 2 (Result 1 / 1) The eastern sector extends into the High Plains and is called
the Central Plains orogeny.
Thought 3 The eastern sector of Colorado orogeny extends into the High Plains. So I
need to search High Plains and find its elevation range.
Action 3 Search[High Plains]
Observation 3 High Plains refers to one of two distinct land regions
Thought 4 I need to instead search High Plains (United States).
Action 4 Search[High Plains (United States)]
Observation 4 The High Plains are a subregion of the Great Plains. From east to west, the
High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft (550 to 2,130
m).[3]
Thought 5 High Plains rise in elevation from around 1,800 to 7,000 ft, so the answer
is 1,800 to 7,000 ft.
Action 5 Finish[1,800 to 7,000 ft]

# Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

# Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT)

- Example:

```Imagine three different experts are answering this question.
All experts will write down 1 step of their thinking,
then share it with the group.
Then all experts will go on to the next step, etc.
If any expert realises they're wrong at any point then they leave.
The question is...
```

# Comparison of Reasoning Frameworks

- ReAct did better on knowledge-intensive tasks
